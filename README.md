# 🐧 Pengi Template

A modern Next.js starter template, supercharged with powerful tools and built to skip the boilerplate + start building faster.

This template is bootstrapped with [`create-t3-app`](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) and fine-tuned with an opinionated stack:

🔗 [tRPC](https://trpc.io/docs) – End-to-end type safety for your API, without the GraphQL overhead

🔐 [BetterAuth](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/introduction) – Seamless, secure authentication that just works

🧠 [Drizzle Orm](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) – A modern, type-safe ORM for working with Postgres

🧩 [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) + Tailwind CSS – Beautifully designed, fully customizable components out of the box

I built this template to save myself from endlessly tweaking create-t3-app outputs — huge thanks to Theo and the T3 team for building such a solid foundation. Now, this is my go-to starting point for any full-stack project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This repo is a GitHub template repository, so you can use it as a starting point for your own project!

To use this template

1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of the repo
2. Choose "Create a new repository"
3. Clone your new repo locally
4. Set up environment variables (see .env.example)
5. Install dependencies & run the dev server!

You're now ready to start building with a full-stack, type-safe Next.js setup!

Note: this project now uses pnpm as the default package manager!

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
